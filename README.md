#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is a structured discipline focused on the development, operation and maintenance of software. its main aim is to provide software that meets the requirements of clients while adthering to provide quality standards, considering limitations like time and budget. 



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Rise of Structured programming; In response to softwre crisis, structured programming emerged as a major improvement in software development. 
-Emergence of Agile Methodology; The Agile methodology replaced rigid, document heavy proccees with adaptive and customer-focused approches, making software development more responsive to changes.
-The Beginning of Software Enginering; The term software engineering was introduced at NATO Software Engineering Conference, ehere the event marked the recognition of software development as a discipline that needed structured methodologies to tackle the growing complexities of software system

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Planning : Define project scope, objectives, and feasibility.
-Requirement Analysis : Gather and document user needs and system requirements.
-Design : Create system architecture, UI, and database structure.
-Implementation (Coding) : Develop the software based on the design.
-Testing : Identify and fix bugs to ensure functionality and performance.
-Deployment : Release the software to users.
-Maintenance : Provide updates, bug fixes, and improvements over time.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall follows a sequential, structured approach where each phase (planning, design, development, testing, deployment) is completed before moving to the next. Changes are difficult to accommodate once development starts, and testing happens only after the entire system is built. Customer involvement is minimal until the final product is delivered. This method is best suited for projects with well-defined, stable requirements, such as government systems or medical software.

-Agile, on the other hand, is iterative and flexible, allowing for continuous changes and improvements. Development and testing occur simultaneously in short cycles (sprints), with frequent customer feedback. This approach is ideal for projects that require quick adaptations, such as mobile apps or web applications where user needs may evolve over time.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software Developer: Writes, tests, and maintains code, implements features, and fixes bugs.
-Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Tests software for bugs, ensures quality, and validates requirements.
-Project Manager (PM): Plans, coordinates, and oversees the project, manages timelines, and ensures team collaboration.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

-IDEs streamline development by providing code editing, debugging, and automation tools in one place. Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA.

-VCS tracks code changes, enables collaboration, and prevents conflicts. Examples: Git, SVN


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Debugging & Bugs : Use debugging tools, write unit tests.
-Changing Requirements : Follow Agile practices, communicate with stakeholders.
-Tight Deadlines : Prioritize tasks, use project management tools.
-Technical Debt : Refactor code regularly, follow best practices.
-Collaboration Issues : Use VCS, clear documentation, and communication tools.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit Testing : Tests individual components or functions to ensure they work correctly. Helps catch bugs early.
-Integration Testing : Verifies interactions between modules or services to ensure they work together. Prevents integration failures.
-System Testing : Tests the entire system as a whole to check overall functionality and performance. Ensures system meets requirements.
-Acceptance Testing : Validates the software against business needs and user expectations. Confirms readiness for release.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective inputs (prompts) to optimize AI model responses. It involves structuring queries clearly, using context, and applying techniques like few-shot learning to guide AI behavior.

Importance:
-Enhances AI accuracy : Well-designed prompts improve relevance and correctness.
-Improves efficiency : Reduces the need for multiple retries or clarifications.
-Customizes AI behavior : Helps tailor responses for specific tasks, like coding or creative writing.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt; Best food
Corrected prompt; What is the best food recipe for spaghetti?
On the second prompt i have given the AI a more clear instruction to give a specific output.
